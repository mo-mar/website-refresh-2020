Would you look at that!

A blog post. On my website. That I built!

This is a revelation, because about 550 days ago when I walked into a web development class for the first time to learn HTML and CSS, I would have never believed that in the near future I would be technically proficient enough to **_make_** my own website, much less create a blog for it with something <a href="http://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">called Gatsby.</a>

But here we are, and I guess I have a blog now.

I don't really have anything grand planned for it. I geniunely enjoy writing (for people and for computers.) and I just wanted a big box to throw words in.

If you end up reading a few, some or many of these words, thank you!

If you don't, well, technically it's too late. Thank you!

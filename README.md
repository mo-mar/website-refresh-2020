This project is a refresh of my [personal website](https://www.thatmohamedomar.com/). It was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which was a joy to learn and use.

My previous website was a standard multi-page HTML/CSS project, but I wanted to spruce it up to mark my first full year as a (employed) web developer. I also want to get back to writing (human words), so I added a blog to the website. (Hence the use of Gatsby).

The project is styled with SASS, and CSS modules were used to handle scoping.
